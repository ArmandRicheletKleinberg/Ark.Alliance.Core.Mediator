# Analysis

`Ark.Alliance.Core.Mediator.Tests` verifies the dispatcher, middleware and streaming components. Tests focus on command handling correctness and integration with dependency injection. They also ensure compile‑time handler registration replaces reflection. Requirements include deterministic results, coverage of error paths and minimal reliance on external services.

## Key Points
- Validate command, query and event flows.
- Cover middleware such as logging, retries and AI decisions.
- Exercise dynamic dispatch and generic handler scenarios.
- Confirm generated registrations work without reflection.
- Use in‑memory brokers to keep tests fast.
- Validate orchestrator host service ordering and timeout policies.
- Assess reflection caching for deterministic handler lookup modes.
- Verify cancellation token handling in streaming scenarios.
