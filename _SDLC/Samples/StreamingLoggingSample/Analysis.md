# Analysis

The sample demonstrates streaming responses with integrated logging and retry middleware. It relies on compileâ€‘time handler registration instead of reflection and runs entirely from the command line or a small container image so developers can evaluate the mediator quickly without external dependencies.

## Key Points
- `PingCommand` returns a simple string to validate basic dispatch.
- `NumberStreamHandler` yields an async stream of integers.
- Middleware prints to the console and retries transient failures.
- Logging and retry middleware use the same pipeline as production apps.
- Dockerfile allows running the sample in an isolated container.
